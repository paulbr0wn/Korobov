# Korobov Lattice R code
R code to generate shifted Korobov lattice point sets, given number of points, dimension, and a generating constant.
For good, space-filling lattices, ensure generating constant is relatively prime with number of points. For optimal generating constant, software such as LatticeBuilder can perform searches.
