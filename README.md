# Korobov
R code to generate a shifted Korobov lattice.
You can use this code to generate a shifted Korobov lattice pointset. You will need to specify the number of points, number of dimensions, a generating constant (we recommend a constant that is relatively prime with number of points), and if you would like to generate a shifted Korobov lattice.
